# TheRightRecipe

"TheRightRecipe" is a web application for finding recipes based on a user-provided ingredient.

- Users can enter an ingredient in the input field and click the "SEARCH" button.
- The application makes an API request to retrieve a list of recipes that include the specified ingredient.
- It filters these recipes based on preparation time (30 minutes or less).
 - It then randomly selects one recipe from the filtered list.
- The selected recipe's details, including its title, image, preparation time, ingredients, and instructions, are displayed to the user.
- Users can view the recipe details, hide them, or like the recipe, adding it to their favorites.


- The application utilizes the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data based on ingredients and retrieve recipe details.
